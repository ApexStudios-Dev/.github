**Fantasy's Furniture** is a modular mod which adds various new **Furniture Sets** and **Decorational** blocks to Minecraft.
These furniture blocks range from but are not limited to, **Beds**, **Seats**, **Bookshelves**, **Doors**, **Ovens**, **Sofas**, **Shelves**, **Counters** and **Doors**.

### Recipes
Each piece of furniture can be crafted from our new **Furniture Station** block by inserting the matching **Wool** & **Plank** blocks along side some **Binding Agent** item (**Clay Ball**).

The **Furniture Station** can be crafted in any 2x2 crafting grid (or larger) by inserting a **Crafting Table** + **Leather**.

### Modules
Fantasy's Furniture has been split up into modules 1 for each furniture set. This is to allow players to pick and choose which furniture sets they wish to be playing with.
Installing Fantasy's Furniture standalone will gain you nothing, so please be sure to install one of the below modules.
