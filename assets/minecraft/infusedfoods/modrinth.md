**Infused Foods** allows players to infuse food items with **Potion Effects**.

To infuse foods simply interact with a **Potion Cauldron** while also holding a **Food** item.
**Potion Cauldrons** are made by simply empting a **Potion** container item into an **Empty Cauldron**.

Infused food can be cleanesd (no longer be infused) by simply crafting them with a **Cleansing Agent** (**Milk Buckets**).
Infused foods can also be crafted with **Spider Eyes** to hide their effects from the players tooltips.
